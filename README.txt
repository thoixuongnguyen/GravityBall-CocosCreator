What I have learnt from this project :

 - Typescript language basic
 - Create sprite, prefab, script, scene, collider event base on each tag
 - Load scene
 - Spawn prefab
 - Movement of player in 2d using velocity instead of position and by input from keyboard

What I haven't achieved yet :

 - Light in cocos 2d ( I can not find that)
 - ParticleSystem ( Still can not create on contact point)
